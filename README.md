# MathProblemsInCode

This code follows the pattern

(0,0)                                                                                                                                                                                
(0,1) (1,0)                                                                                                                                                                          
(0,2) (1,1) (2,0)                                                                                                                                                                    
(0,3) (1,2) (2,1) (3,0)....

It is currently set to use a 2d array of size [4][4], but works for any 2d array of size [n][n]!
